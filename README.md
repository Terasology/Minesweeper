# Minesweeper

The Minesweeper module adds minefields to Terasology. The minefields appear across the world upon loading. The basic goal is to mine all the surrounding blocks and mark all the mines without setting off the entire field.

## Rules

- Each block will show how many adjacent blocks have mines
- Each mine/counting block will count diagonals, sides, and corners
- A mine will count itself

## Controls
- E will mark a mine

## Notes
- Look out for corner blocks 
- Outside blocks of a field are never mines
- Rules from 2D minesweeper are still applicable
